Logo Replacement Instructions

To replace the existing React logo with your financial logo:

1. Rename the image you shared to the following files:
   - finance-logo.ico (favicon - you may need to convert it to .ico format)
   - finance-logo192.png (192x192 pixel version)
   - finance-logo512.png (512x512 pixel version)

2. Place these files in the "public" folder of your React app

3. You can use an online converter tool like https://www.favicon-generator.org/ to:
   - Upload your logo image
   - Generate all the required sizes
   - Download the package and extract the needed files

4. If you want to keep the original logo files as backup, don't delete them,
   just leave them in the public folder - your app will now use the new files
   as specified in index.html and manifest.json

5. After adding these files, restart your development server using:
   npm start (or your usual start command)

The index.html and manifest.json files have already been updated to refer to these new logo files.
